#+TITLE: Github Pages

These are a service offered by Github to publish static web pages on Github
servers.

The alternative to this would be using some other hosting provider, or go "raw"
and deploy our own webserver on a VPS, AWS or w/e, but we'll check this out
first because it's free and _should_ be relatively easy to set up.
