#+TITLE: Personal Page

A personal (or organisation) page is what's served by
~<user/org-name>.github.io~. You can create on by creating a repo with that name
(e.g. hanst99.github.io in my case) on that respective user/organisation.
Otherwise, it seems it works just like any other github pages project.
